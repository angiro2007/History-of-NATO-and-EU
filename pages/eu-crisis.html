                <h1>The Crises of the European Union</h1>
                <h2>The Eurozone Crisis</h2>
                <p>The global economic and financial crisis had repercussions on the euro area, which fell into recession. After the collapse of major European banks, many countries found themselves in difficulty—especially Greece, part of whose public debt had been concealed with the help of consultants from the investment bank Goldman Sachs. The country was forced to request financial assistance from the euro area and the IMF, in exchange for which it had to implement austerity measures.</p>

                <h2>The Irish Case</h2>
                <p>Ireland, by stepping in to support its banks, also saw its public debt surge. However, the country did not want to request assistance from the euro area, fearing it would be forced in return to raise its low corporate tax rates. In any case, it received assistance in exchange for adopting a strict plan.</p>

                <h2>Other Countries in Difficulty</h2>
                <p>Subsequently, Portugal, Greece for a second time, Spain, and later Cyprus received financial assistance from the euro area; meanwhile, austerity plans were implemented almost everywhere across the continent.</p>


                <h2>The Migration Crisis</h2>
                <p>On the continent’s borders, the so-called Arab Spring created instability in many countries. The civil war in Syria, a second civil war in Libya and in Iraq, and other events such as the war in Afghanistan and violence in the Horn of Africa pushed many people to migrate toward Europe. Despite the construction of walls along the Turkish border, in 2015 more than one million migrants entered the Schengen Area.</p>

                <h2>Control Measures</h2>
                <p>Europe sought to slow the flow of migration. Security patrols were reinforced in the Mediterranean Sea, while some countries temporarily reintroduced checks at their borders. In addition, the European Union signed agreements with Turkey and later with Libya—where the political situation is highly unstable—to control and block so-called illegal migration routes in exchange for financial aid.</p>

                <p>Reception centers for migrants were funded, mainly in Italy and Greece, where migrants awaited regularization in overcrowded conditions. The migration crisis divided European countries and fueled the rise of nationalist and Eurosceptic parties.</p>



                <h2>Brexit</h2>
                <p>In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a referendum in favor of leaving the European Union. The country then entered long and difficult negotiations with the European Union to define the terms of its withdrawal. After numerous setbacks, an agreement was finally reached, and the United Kingdom left the EU on 31 January 2020.</p>

                <p>While the United Kingdom no longer had any decision-making power within the bloc, it continued to contribute to the European budget and receive funding at least until the end of the year. By that deadline, it was expected to negotiate future agreements with the EU, particularly regarding customs duties, freedom of movement, the status of Europeans living in the UK and vice versa, and the status of the border separating Ireland from Northern Ireland.</p>



                <h2>The European Union Today</h2>
                <p>After the United Kingdom’s departure, the European Union has 27 member states with a population of around 450 million. Negotiations are ongoing for the accession of new countries, mainly in the Balkans. Negotiations for Turkey’s accession, which began in 2005, are at a standstill.</p>

                <p>19 countries are members of the euro area, while six other countries have adopted the euro without being members of the euro area or the EU. Finally, the Schengen Area now includes 26 states, four of which are not EU members, with Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania expected to integrate soon.</p>
