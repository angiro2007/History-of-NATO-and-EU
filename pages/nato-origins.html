                <h1>The Origins of NATO</h1>


                <h2>The End of World War II</h2>
                <p>Victory in Europe and celebrations around the world were even greater because of the memory of the triumph of Nazi barbarism and its definitive overthrow. But the celebrations did not last long. World War II had left a trail of destruction across Europe, killing 36 million people—many of them civilians—and displacing millions more. The end of the Nazi regime also paved the way for Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe.</p>

                <h2>The Rise of the Soviet Union</h2>
                <p>The Soviet Union was emerging as a superpower. This worried Western Europe and the United States. Tensions were high, and political instability was gripping Europe, with Germany at the center of it all.</p>


                <h2>The German Question</h2>
                <p>Despite their differences, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union met in 1947 to decide on Germany’s future. But there was little success. After the failed meeting, Ernest Bevin, then the UK Foreign Secretary, worked to find a solution. The Western powers needed to organize in order to defend themselves against Joseph Stalin’s expansionist ambitions and the Soviet Union’s military power.</p>


                <h2>The Brussels Treaty (1948)</h2>
                <p>A year later, Bevin’s persistence led to the creation of the Brussels Treaty, signed by Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The treaty aimed to demonstrate cooperation among Western European countries and encourage the United States to join the alliance.</p>


                <h2>The Birth of NATO (1949)</h2>
                <p>On April 4, 1949, the US did join. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington, DC by 12 countries. Then US President Harry Truman underlined the purpose of the treaty: to maintain friendly relations and economic cooperation with one another, to consult together whenever the territory or independence of any of them is threatened, and to come to the aid of any one of them who may be attacked.</p>


                <h2>Article 5 - Collective Defense</h2>
                <p>Article 5 states: "If a NATO ally is a victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the ally attacked." This principle of collective defense became the cornerstone of NATO's mission and remains so to this day.</p>

                <h2>The First Expansions (1952-1955)</h2>
                <p>In 1952, more countries joined NATO: Turkey and Greece. Then three years later, West Germany followed. This was the last straw for the Soviet Union, and it responded by forming its own alliance.</p>


                <h2>The Warsaw Pact</h2>
                <p>The Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. Just like NATO, the Warsaw Pact was a treaty of collective defense among the Soviet Union and its communist partners in Eastern Europe. The world was now divided into two military blocs, setting the stage for decades of Cold War tensions.</p>
