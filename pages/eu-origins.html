                <h1>The Origins of the European Union</h1>

                <h2>The Post-War Period and the Division of Europe</h2>
                <p>The history of the European Union begins at the end of the Second World War, when the European continent lay devastated, leaving the United States and the USSR as the two main world powers. Their growing rivalry marked the beginning of the Cold War. While the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe, the West looked to the United States for reconstruction aid. The continent was divided by the Iron Curtain, but in Western Europe the idea of European unity began to take shape.</p>

                <h2>The Schuman Declaration (1950)</h2>
                <p>On 9 May 1950, France, through its Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Schuman, proposed Franco-German reconciliation by placing coal and steel production under a common authority. These resources were central to industrial power and essential for weapons manufacturing. The aim was to revive the economy and maintain peace, with the project open to other countries wishing to join.</p>

                <h2>The European Coal and Steel Community (1951)</h2>
                <p>The following year in Paris, six countries signed a treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. As Germany was divided by the Iron Curtain, only West Germany took part. The six founding countries were France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</p>



                <h2>The Treaties of Rome (1957)</h2>
                <p>To accelerate Europe’s development, the six founding countries met in Rome on 25 March 1957 to sign two new treaties. The first created the European Economic Community, whose main objective was to establish a common market, including the free movement of workers and the elimination of customs duties between member states. It also defined common policies on transport, trade, and agriculture.</p>

                <p>The Common Agricultural Policy aimed, among other objectives, to increase agricultural productivity, offer reasonable prices, and ensure a fair standard of living for farmers. The second treaty established the European Atomic Energy Community, coordinating civil nuclear research programs. The Treaties of Rome entered into force in 1958, though it took several years for their policies to be fully implemented.</p>

                <h2>The First Applications for Membership</h2>
                <p>Many countries applied to join the Communities, including the United Kingdom. However, France under Charles de Gaulle vetoed the application, considering the UK too closely aligned with the United States. In 1967, the UK renewed its application, but France opposed it once again.</p>


                <h2>The European Institutions</h2>
                <p>The institutions of the three Communities were merged to allow more efficient operation. A single Commission was established, composed of commissioners appointed by heads of state, responsible for proposing European legislation in the common interest. The Council, composed of ministers from the member states, approves, amends, or rejects the Commission’s proposals. A Parliament represents the peoples of Europe and gives its opinion on Commission proposals, with its powers increasing through later treaties. Finally, a Court of Justice rules on the legality of decisions taken.</p>

                <h2>The First Enlargements (1973)</h2>
                <p>With the removal of tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and the free movement of workers, the economic situation improved rapidly, encouraging a new wave of membership applications. This time negotiations were successful, although in Norway the population rejected membership in a referendum. In 1973, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Denmark joined the Community.</p>

                <p>In Paris, heads of state and government agreed to create the European Council, with leaders meeting at least three times a year to define the Community’s general guidelines.</p>
