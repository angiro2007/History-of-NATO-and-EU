                <h1>The Expansion of the European Union</h1>


                <h2>Southern Enlargement</h2>
                <p>In southern Europe, following the end of dictatorships in Portugal, Greece, and Spain, the three countries applied for membership. In 1979, members of the European Parliament were elected by universal suffrage for the first time. In 1981, Greece joined the Community, while the following year Greenland, granted greater autonomy by Denmark, chose to leave the Community after a referendum.</p>

                <h2>The British Budget Issue</h2>
                <p>In 1984, the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher argued that it did not benefit sufficiently from the Common Agricultural Policy, which at the time accounted for 80% of EU expenditure. The country negotiated a reduction in its contribution to the Community budget.</p>

                <h2>Spain and Portugal (1986)</h2>
                <p>In 1986, Spain and Portugal joined the Community. The twelve Member States and the European Commission boosted the internal market by signing the Single European Act. Beyond removing customs duties, the aim was to eliminate all obstacles to the free movement of people, goods, capital, and services, creating the “Single Market” to be completed by 1993.</p>


                <h2>The Fall of the Wall and German Reunification</h2>
                <p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany was reunified. In the East, the USSR could no longer contain uprisings and collapsed, opening new prospects for the Community, which established contacts with Eastern European countries.</p>


                <h2>The Maastricht Treaty (1992)</h2>
                <p>On 7 February 1992, European heads of state signed the Maastricht Treaty. The European Union was created and granted new powers. The treaty provided for economic union and the future creation of a common European currency. All countries ratified the treaty, including Denmark, where two referendums and negotiations were required to secure exemptions from the common currency.</p>

                <h2>The 1995 Enlargement</h2>
                <p>A new wave of countries applied to join the Union, but Switzerland and later Norway rejected potential membership through referendums. In contrast, negotiations succeeded in Austria, Sweden, and Finland, and in 1995 the EU expanded to 15 members.</p>


                <h2>The Schengen Agreement</h2>
                <p>Signed in Schengen, Luxembourg in 1985, the Schengen Agreement was gradually implemented from 1995. Its aim was to abolish border controls and allow full freedom of movement within the European Union. The agreement was incorporated into the EU through the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>


                <h2>The Introduction of the Euro</h2>
                <p>The common currency project advanced and was named the Euro. However, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark chose not to adopt it. The remaining member states established the European Central Bank. The Euro was officially launched in 1999, although it entered circulation only on 1 January 2002.</p>

                <h2>The Treaty of Nice</h2>
                <p>While negotiations for EU enlargement continued, heads of state met in Nice to improve the Union’s structure. The outcome of the Treaty of Nice was controversial, and two referendums were required in Ireland for it to enter into force.</p>


                <h2>The Major Enlargement (2004)</h2>
                <p>On 1 May 2004, ten new countries joined the European Union. All new members joined the Schengen Area except Cyprus, as part of the island has been controlled by the Turkish army since 1974.</p>

                <h2>The European Constitutional Treaty</h2>
                <p>After the partial failure of the Treaty of Nice, the 25 heads of state met in Rome to once again rationalize the functioning of the European Union. They aimed to create a constitutional treaty to replace all existing treaties with a single text. This sparked intense debate across Europe. Fearing an overly powerful EU at the expense of national sovereignty, French and Dutch voters rejected the treaty in referendums, triggering a period of reflection and consultation among member states.</p>


                <h2>Romania, Bulgaria and the Lisbon Treaty (2007)</h2>
                <p>On 1 January 2007, Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union. In the same year, 27 heads of state signed the Lisbon Treaty, aimed at strengthening and improving the functioning of the Union after enlargement. The treaty defined the EU’s role as promoting peace, supporting sustainable development, combating social exclusion and discrimination, and safeguarding cultural heritage. It was ratified by all states except Ireland, where a referendum initially rejected it, requiring further negotiations and a second referendum.</p>

                <h2>Croatia (2013)</h2>
                <p>In 2013, Croatia joined the European Union.</p>
