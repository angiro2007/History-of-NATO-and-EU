                <h1>NATO in the Modern Era</h1>


                <h2>A New Role for NATO</h2>
                <p>But NATO didn't disintegrate. Instead, it took on a new role. It saw itself as a source of peace and security and decided to expand its missions globally. As instability was slowly gripping Europe again, NATO found an opening and took on a peacekeeping role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A few years later, it did the same in Kosovo too. Critics questioned their involvement and success while NATO was trying to justify the reason for its existence.</p>


                <h2>Peacekeeping Missions in the Balkans</h2>
                <p>The peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo marked a significant shift in NATO's mission. No longer solely focused on defending against Soviet aggression, NATO was now positioning itself as a force for stability and peace in regions affected by conflict. These missions, while controversial, demonstrated NATO's willingness to adapt to the post-Cold War security environment.</p>


                <h2>September 11 and Article 5</h2>
                <p>The early 2000s were a chance for NATO to expand beyond its borders. In 2001, specifically after 9/11, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time, the same article that considers an attack on an ally as an attack on all members. It launched its biggest ever combat operation in Afghanistan with the aim to stabilize the region, train Afghan forces, and make sure the war-torn country won't be a safe haven for terrorists ever again.</p>


                <h2>The War in Afghanistan</h2>
                <p>It has been 17 years since the war in Afghanistan started, and the US and NATO are still there. So are the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The mission in Afghanistan became NATO's longest and most challenging operation, raising questions about the alliance's role in counter-terrorism and nation-building far beyond its traditional European theater.</p>

                <h2>Global Operations</h2>
                <p>NATO also had many missions in Africa, South Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea. These operations demonstrated the alliance's expanding global reach and its efforts to address security challenges beyond the North Atlantic region.</p>


                <h2>The Crimea Crisis (2014)</h2>
                <p>But things started to change in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. Some say Russia was provoked by NATO, while others say it was pure Russian aggression. This was a wake-up call for NATO, and it started to take extra measures in the Baltics.</p>


                <h2>NATO Today - New Challenges</h2>
                <p>So is NATO still around because the Soviets might come back? Or is it trying to protect its members from aggressive nationalism? The annexation of Crimea forced NATO to refocus on its original mission of collective defense, particularly for its Eastern European members who felt increasingly vulnerable to Russian aggression. The alliance continues to navigate between its traditional defensive role and its newer global security missions, adapting to a world where threats come not just from nation-states but also from terrorism, cyber attacks, and regional instability.</p>
