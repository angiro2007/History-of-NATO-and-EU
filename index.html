        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The history of Europe after the Second World War has been deeply shaped by the creation of two fundamental organizations: the European Union and NATO. Both emerged from the ruins of the most devastating conflict in human history and followed parallel yet distinct paths, contributing to shaping the Europe we know today.</p>

            <p>The European Union originated from the idea of economic and political unity, with the aim of making a new war between European nations impossible through economic integration and cooperation. NATO, on the other hand, was created as a defensive military alliance to protect Western Europe from Soviet expansion during the Cold War.</p>
